# Image Segmentation using k-means 
Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into groups in order to appropriately identify the pixels in a decision-making application. It separates a picture into a number of distinct sections with high similarity between pixels in each and high contrast between regions.

There are a variety of image segmentation methods, but clustering is one of the most efficient. It is a widely used technique in the machine learning field.

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique
